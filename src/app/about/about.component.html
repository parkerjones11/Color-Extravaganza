        <h2>Parker Jones</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Parker - I'm a senior Computer Science major at CSU. I'm located in Fort Collins, and I'm originally 
            from Morrison, CO; I moved up here about three years ago with my cat Gray Souffle. I love to crochet, play 
            video games, travel, and watch any and all seasons/franchises of the Real Housewives (if you haven't watched 
            any, you haven't lived). I'm looking forward to gaining more experience in front-end programming through this 
            project!

        <h2>Riley Nelson</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Riley! I'm a Junior Computer Science major at CSU and a second-degree seeking student in Elementary Education. 
            Before returning to school, I taught kindergarten, first grade, and outdoor education for seven years. I'm originally 
            from Boise, Idaho, and moved to Colorado with my partner of seven years, Kelton, along with our dog Obi and our cat Luna.
            I pet sit part-time and absolutely love all animals. In my free time, I enjoy reading, crocheting, creating art, hiking, 
            backpacking, snowboarding, and camping. Anything outdoors is my happy place. I'm passionate about combining my love for 
            education, accessibility, and programming, and I’m especially excited to explore front-end design more through this project.</p>

        <h2>Kalena Lam</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm a junior studying Computer Science, specifically Human-Centered Computing. I'm originally from Honolulu, Hawaiʻi and intend to move back there after I graduate.
            I love to surf and can't live without it! But, snowboarding is nice for these four years, especially powder. I am super passionate about Hawaiian language, culture, and ways of thinking
            and want to explore how technology can coexist with Indigeneity, and perhaps assist us further in being stewards to our environment. </p>
